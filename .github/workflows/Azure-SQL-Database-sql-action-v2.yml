# Workflow which shows how to create a dacpac based on a database project and deploy using sql-action v2
# For this to work you must create two secrets
#   AZURE_CREDENTIALS - Which are credential you use for the Azure Login action as per https://bit.ly/3KjPEc4
#   AZURESQLDB_CONNECTION_STRING - Connestion string to your Azure SQL Database
name: Update Azure SQL database

#Sets the trigger to update when update is pushed to a keyvault-feature branch

  push:
    branches:

  # Job to build and publish the dacpac

    # windows-2019 image works better at the moment
    runs-on: windows-2019

    # Steps to deploy the updates to Azure SQL Database
    # To keep this example simple, the Firewall settings in the logical SQL Server allows access from Azure services and resources
    # An alternative is to use the Azure Login GitHub Action https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login
